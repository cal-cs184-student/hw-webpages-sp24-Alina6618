        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Through this homework, we embarked on a journey to develop a sophisticated path tracer capable of producing photorealistic images. We began by optimizing the rendering process with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), significantly improving efficiency in handling complex scenes by streamlining ray-object intersection tests. Progressing further, we tackled the simulation of direct illumination, crafting lighting models that accurately depicted the influence of light emanating directly from sources. Our exploration deepened as we introduced global illumination to our repertoire, enabling us to capture the intricate dance of light as it bounces across multiple surfaces, thereby injecting our scenes with lifelike lighting effects, such as color bleeding and soft shadows. Utilizing Monte Carlo methods, we adeptly handled diffuse reflection sampling and implemented strategies like Russian Roulette for unbiased path termination, striking a delicate balance between rendering performance and image quality. Through these endeavors, we gained a profound understanding of key concepts in photorealistic rendering, including spatial data structures, material behavior under light, and complex light transport models. By the conclusion of the homework, we successfully rendered complex 3D scenes with detailed lighting and shadows, showcasing our advanced skills in creating visually stunning and realistic images.</p>

        <div class="question"><p>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</p></div>
	<ul>
		<li>A lower ks makes the cloth more flexible and less resistant to stretching. When subjected to gravity, the cloth stretches more and exhibits a more fluid-like behavior. It takes longer to settle into a resting state because the springs are less forceful in pulling the cloth back to its original shape.</li>
		<li>A higher ks results in a stiffer cloth. The springs are very resistant to stretching, causing the cloth to retain its shape more rigidly against external forces. The cloth settles into a resting state more quickly, as the strong springs rapidly counteract any displacements.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Above: Low ks (1) and High ks (100000).</p>
	<div class="question"><p>What about for density?</p></div>
	<ul>
		<li>A lower density makes the cloth lighter. It settles more slowly under gravity alone, as there is less force pulling it down. The cloth is also less stretched out as the gravitational force acting on it is smaller (it weighs less).</li>
		<li>Increasing the density makes the cloth heavier so it is more stretched out. Heavier cloth also falls and settles faster due to the greater force of gravity acting on it.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Above: Low density (1) and High density (100000). </p>
	<div class="question"><p>What about for damping?</p></div>
	<ul>
		<li>Low damping means that there is less resistance to motion changes, leading to more prolonged oscillations once the cloth is released. The cloth continues to swing and ripple for a longer time before settling.</li>
		<li>High damping adds resistance to motion changes, causing the cloth to quickly lose any introduced energy. As a result, movements are more muted, and once the cloth comes to its final place, it does not swing anymore. This makes the cloth appear heavy and less responsive to forces.</li>
	</ul>

        <div class="question"><p>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</p></div>

        </div>
	<p>Top to Bottom: ks=5000; ks=500; ks=50000.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Default ks (5000): The cloth drapes over the sphere in a balanced manner, showing a natural-looking interaction. The cloth conforms to the shape of the sphere without too much stretching or compression.</li>
		<li>Low ks (500): A lower ks results in a more flexible and stretchy cloth. As it drapes over the sphere, There is more significant sagging and stretching of the fabric. The cloth also clings closer to the sphere due to its increased flexibility, resembling a thinner or more lightweight fabric.</li>
		<li>High ks (50000): With a very high ks, the cloth becomes stiffer. This rigidity makes the cloth less prone to conform closely to the sphere's surface. The cloth hovers slightly above the sphere in some areas, as the strong springs resist deformation. This could resemble a stiffer or heavier fabric that doesn't easily bend or wrap around objects.</li>

        </div>
	<p>With a lower density (as shown in the first graph), the cloth falls with fewer self-collisions and a smoother surface. As it folds on the plane, it becomes smoother and readily unfolds into a flat sheet of cloth.</p>
        <p>ks = 1000:</p>
	<div class="image-comparison-container">
                <img src="images/task4-9.png" alt="Cubeman Shrugging" class="responsive-image">

        </div>
	<p>With a higher KS value (as depicted in the second group of graphs), the cloth falls with reduced self-collisions and a smoother surface. When folded on the plane, it becomes smoother and effortlessly expands into a flat sheet of cloth.</p>
	
	<h2 id="task5">Part 5</h2>
	<div class="question"><p>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</p></div>
	<ul>
		<li>A shader program operates on the GPU, executing in parallel. It enables customizable inputs and operations within the graphics pipeline, and then outputs a single 4-dimensional vector.</li>
		<li>Vertex shaders enable one to alter vertices’ positions and normal vectors. The final position could be used in fragment shader. Fragment shader takes in these geometric properties and data prepared by vertex shaders and then computes the colour.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="question"><p>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</p></div>
	<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a modification of the Phong shading model. It calculates the pixel values between vertices and accounts for ambient reflection, diffuse reflection, and specular reflection. One could adjust parameters such as the intensity of light and the coefficient for reflection.</p>
	<p>Only the ambient component:</p>

You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.</p></div>

	<p>Compare two approaches:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bump mapping alters only the normals of an object, creating an illusion of texture without modifying the object's actual geometry. In contrast, displacement mapping adjusts both the vertices' positions and their normals, resulting in a physical alteration of the object's shape to add real depth and detail.</li>
		<li>Bump mapping generates the appearance of bumps and texture, and displacement mapping authentically changes the vertices' positions, producing real physical changes on the object's surface.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>For bump mapping, changing coarseness barely results in any difference. The reason behind is that the number of vertices doesn’t influence the mapping.</li>
		<li>For displacement mapping, increased coarseness significantly results in more curvature in sphere’s edges.  It comes from the fact that it results from changes in physical vertices.</li>
