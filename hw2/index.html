        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>In this CS184 assignment, we explored geometric modeling, starting with Bezier curves and surfaces using the de Casteljau algorithm, moving on to manipulate triangle meshes with the half-edge data structure, and finally implemented the Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling. Through these tasks, we gained a deep understanding of how shapes and surfaces are constructed and refined in computer graphics. The assignment was both challenging and enlightening, offering hands-on experience with complex geometric transformations and the efficient manipulation of meshes. Implementing the Loop subdivision, in particular, was a highlight, allowing us to see firsthand how coarse meshes could be transformed into smoother, more detailed versions.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2 id="task1">Task 1</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</p></div>
        <p><strong>De Casteljau’s algorithm</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic idea:</strong> For each Bezier curve with control point (P0, … , Pn), one can form a polygon by connecting these points consecutively (P0-P1, P1-P2…) For each segment Pi-Pi+1, based on certain parameter p, one could find a point P’i that divides the segment into p and 1-p portions. Now treating P’0, …, P’ n-1, as another set of Bezier curve control points, repeat the steps above until a single new point can be determined. This point corresponds to the parameter t. By varying t between 0 and 1, the final point traces out a smoother curve.</li>
	    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> When given a vector of point, compute points[i] * (1-t) + points[i + 1] * t for i in the range of the size of points. Return a vector of newly computed values. This vector contains all new control points (intermediate or final interpolated). Recursively call on this function until there’s a single point.</li>
	</ul>

        <h2 id="task2">Task 2</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</p></div>
        <p><strong>De Casteljau’s algorithm extended to Bezier surface</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic idea:</strong> A Bezier surface typically consists of an NxN array of control points and is parameterised by two parameters (u, v) to generate a 2D surface. First, De Casteljau's algorithm is applied to each row of control points along the u-axis, producing one intermediate control point per row Once these N intermediate control points are obtained, the algorithm is then applied in a 1D manner along the v-axis to these N points, thereby evaluating the final point on the surface corresponding to the parameters u and v.</li>
	    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> In evaluate(), we take each vector in control points and evaluate1D(vec, u) along u-axis. Evaluate1D helps us to full evaluate de Casteljau's algorithm for a vector of points at scalar parameter t. With all these new final interpolated points, we apply evaluate1D over (final_vec, v) to evaluate the curve over v-axis.</li>

        <h2 id="task3">Task 3</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</p></div>
        <p>In this implementation, we initiate a vector3D called final_vec. We begin with the half-edge associated with the current vertex. For the face connected to this vertex, we identify two of its edges. By taking the cross product of these edge vectors, we obtain a vector perpendicular to the face (the preliminary normal). The area of the face is calculated as half the norm of this cross-product. For a correctly oriented normal, we normalize this cross-product vector. This normalized vector, scaled by the face's area (computed as 0.5 * crossProduct.norm()), is accumulated into final_vec. This process is repeated for all faces around the vertex by iterating over the half-edges until returning to the starting half-edge. Finally, final_vec is normalized to obtain the area-weighted average normal for the vertex.</p>

        <h2 id="task4">Task 4</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</p></div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> We iterated through all edges, vertex, and half edges and explicitly state what their new next()/vertex()/face() is. </li>
	    <li><strong>Debugging Tricks:</strong> To ensure accuracy during implementation, we created detailed diagrams representing the states of the mesh before and after the flip operation, focusing on e0 as the central edge. Each diagram included comprehensive labelling of edges, half edges, and vertices. In the code, we then explicitly set the next, twin, vertex, and other relevant properties for every half edge/edge/vertex/face involved in the flip. This approach, although resulting in some redundancy, served as a verification method, allowing me to cross-reference the code with the diagrams and confirm that every half edge was correctly updated.</li>

        <h2 id="task6">Task 6</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</p>
	<ul>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong>We followed the instructions outlined on the webpage: We iterate through each vertex, calculating its new position using the formula (1-nu)(v->position) + u*sum_of_neighbors. Additionally, we set vNew->isNew to false. Next, we proceed to iterate through the edges to calculate the new midpoint, while simultaneously creating a vector to accumulate all these oldEdges. We then move through all the old edges, flipping them if !e->isNew evaluates to true. Following this, we flip any new edge that connects an old vertex with a new one. Finally, we update the final Vertex::position with the new vertex positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Interesting Tricks:</strong> We also test the functionality step by step. Initially, we assess the split edges' functionality by commenting out sections 4 & 5 and continue debugging. This process is repeated until clicking “L” successfully demonstrates an edge splitting, without any structural changes.</li>

	<p>Above is the cube after loop subdivisions. We could see that sharp corners become smoother after subdivision. </p>

	<p>However, if we pre-split some edges on places where we want to keep the sharpness, the smoothing effect will be reduced as follows:</p>

        </div>
	<p>  </p>
	<div class="question"><p>Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</p>
	<ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-process:</strong>Originally, the mesh becomes asymmetrical due to each face having a unique arrangement of edges, either from left to right or from right to left. Consequently, certain corners accumulate more incoming edges. With additional subdivisions, some corners become increasingly divided.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> To address this, I ensured every face is split into an X shape by dividing all edges on each face. This way, every face begins with an identical pattern of edges, leading to a naturally symmetrical outcome.</ul>
