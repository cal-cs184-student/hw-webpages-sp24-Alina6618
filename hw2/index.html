        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>In this homework, we embarked on an explorative journey into the fundamentals of graphics rendering, focusing on the intricacies of rasterization, texture mapping, and sampling techniques. The project was segmented into several key tasks, each designed to deepen our understanding of graphics rendering processes and to challenge our ability to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Key Implementations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rasterization of Triangles:</strong> Developed an algorithm to rasterize triangles, identifying and filling pixels within the bounding box that fall inside the triangle. This foundational task enhanced our understanding of how shapes are rendered on a pixel grid.</li>
            <li><strong>Supersampling for Antialiasing:</strong> Implemented supersampling to improve image quality by reducing aliasing effects. This technique, which involves rendering at a higher resolution and then downsampling, taught us the importance of sample rates in determining the balance between performance and visual fidelity.</li>
            <li><strong>Barycentric Coordinates:</strong> Utilized barycentric coordinates for color interpolation within triangles. This method allowed for smooth color gradients and introduced us to the concept of using weighted averages for rendering.</li>
            <li><strong>Texture Mapping and Sampling:</strong> Explored different pixel sampling methods—nearest and bilinear—to apply textures to shapes. This task demonstrated the impact of sampling techniques on texture quality and introduced us to texture mapping's complexities.</li>
            <li><strong>Level of Detail (LOD) and Mipmapping:</strong> Implemented LOD and mipmapping to select appropriate texture resolutions based on distance. This optimization technique underscored the trade-offs between rendering speed, memory usage, and image quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Insights Gained:</h3>
        <p>Completing this project has been an enlightening experience, offering us a practical perspective on the computational aspects of generating 2D representations of 3D scenes. The hands-on work with rasterization and texture mapping illuminated the challenges of rendering realistic images in real-time applications. One of the most interesting insights was the significant impact that antialiasing and sampling methods have on the final image quality. Moreover, the exploration of barycentric coordinates and their application in color interpolation and texture mapping was particularly fascinating, highlighting the mathematical beauty underlying computer graphics.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the project allowed us to appreciate the delicate balance between computational efficiency and visual quality, especially in the context of level sampling and mipmapping. It was intriguing to see firsthand how different sampling techniques can dramatically affect rendering outcomes and performance metrics.</p>

        
        <h2 id="task1">Task 1</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</p></div>
        <h3>De Casteljau’s algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic idea:</strong> For each Bezier curve with control point (P0, … , Pn), one can form a polygon by connecting these points consecutively (P0-P1, P1-P2…) For each segment Pi-Pi+1, based on certain parameter p, one could find a point P’i that divides the segment into p and 1-p portions. Now treating P’0, …, P’ n-1, as another set of Bezier curve control points, repeat the steps above until a single new point can be determined. This point corresponds to the parameter t. By varying t between 0 and 1, the final point traces out a smoother curve.</li>
	    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> When given a vector of point, compute points[i] * (1-t) + points[i + 1] * t for i in the range of the size of points. Return a vector of newly computed values. This vector contains all new control points (intermediate or final interpolated). Recursively call on this function until there’s a single point.</li>
	</ul>

        <h2 id="task2">Task 2</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</p></div>
        <h3>De Casteljau’s algorithm extended to Bezier surface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic idea:</strong> A Bezier surface typically consists of an NxN array of control points and is parameterised by two parameters (u, v) to generate a 2D surface. First, De Casteljau's algorithm is applied to each row of control points along the u-axis, producing one intermediate control point per row Once these N intermediate control points are obtained, the algorithm is then applied in a 1D manner along the v-axis to these N points, thereby evaluating the final point on the surface corresponding to the parameters u and v.</li>
	    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> In evaluate(), we take each vector in control points and evaluate1D(vec, u) along u-axis. Evaluate1D helps us to full evaluate de Casteljau's algorithm for a vector of points at scalar parameter t. With all these new final interpolated points, we apply evaluate1D over (final_vec, v) to evaluate the curve over v-axis.</li>

        <h2 id="task3">Task 3</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</p></div>
        <p>In my implementation, I initiate a vector3D called final_vec. I begin with the half-edge associated with the current vertex. For the face connected to this vertex, I identify two of its edges. By taking the cross product of these edge vectors, I obtain a vector perpendicular to the face (the preliminary normal). The area of the face is calculated as half the norm of this cross-product. For a correctly oriented normal, I normalize this cross-product vector. This normalized vector, scaled by the face's area (computed as 0.5 * crossProduct.norm()), is accumulated into final_vec. This process is repeated for all faces around the vertex by iterating over the half-edges until returning to the starting half-edge. Finally, final_vec is normalized to obtain the area-weighted average normal for the vertex.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> I iterated through all edges, vertex, and half edges and explicitly state what their new next()/vertex()/face() is. </li>
	    <li><strong>Debugging Tricks:</strong> To ensure accuracy during implementation, I created detailed diagrams representing the states of the mesh before and after the flip operation, focusing on e0 as the central edge. Each diagram included comprehensive labelling of edges, half edges, and vertices. In the code, I then explicitly set the next, twin, vertex, and other relevant properties for every half edge/edge/vertex/face involved in the flip. This approach, although resulting in some redundancy, served as a verification method, allowing me to cross-reference the code with the diagrams and confirm that every half edge was correctly updated.</li>

        <h2 id="task6">Task 6</h2>
        <div class="question"><p>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</p>
	<ul>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong>We followed the instructions outlined on the webpage: We iterate through each vertex, calculating its new position using the formula (1-nu)(v->position) + u*sum_of_neighbors. Additionally, we set vNew->isNew to false. Next, we proceed to iterate through the edges to calculate the new midpoint, while simultaneously creating a vector to accumulate all these oldEdges. We then move through all the old edges, flipping them if !e->isNew evaluates to true. Following this, we flip any new edge that connects an old vertex with a new one. Finally, we update the final Vertex::position with the new vertex positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Interesting Tricks:</strong> We also test the functionality step by step. Initially, we assess the split edges' functionality by commenting out sections 4 & 5 and continue debugging. This process is repeated until clicking “L” successfully demonstrates an edge splitting, without any structural changes.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="question"><p>Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</p>
	<div class="question"><p>Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</p>
